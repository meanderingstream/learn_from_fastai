# What can you learn from Fast.ai MOOC

This is a presentation about the high level aspects of the Fast.ai MOOC.  It was given to the Tampa Artificial Intelligence Meetup group on May 2, 2018.

At the time of the presentation, the Deep Learning Part 1 course and Machine Learning videos and notebooks had been released.  Deep Learning Part 1 had just had their last in-person class two days before.  The videos and forums for Part 2 hadn't been released yet.  The information on Part 2 was gleaned from @jph00 twitter feed and the dw2 folder of the fastai/fastai project on Github.
